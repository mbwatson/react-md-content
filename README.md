# React App w/ Markdown Content Pages

This is a proof-of-concept application that would allow a creator to define page content as markdown files (`src/content/*.md`) and page navigation structure (`src/content/site-map.js`).
This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that was bootstrapped with [RENCI/create-renci-app](https://github.com/RENCI/create-renci-app).

### 🚧 Development

You'll need Node v14.16.0. If you don't have that version installed, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Setup with `nvm use 14.16.0`. Run development server on port `8080` with `npm start`.

### 🎁 Production

Build the application for production with `npm run build`. The `dist` directory will contain the bundled files.
